`npm install dahi`

create a channel
---

`never()`
creates a channel that's already closed 

`later(wait)`
creates a channel that produces a single `value` after `wait` milliseconds, and then closes.

`interval(wait, value)`
creates a channel that produces the same `value` each `interval` milliseconds, and never closes.

`sequentially(interval, values)`
creates a channel containing the `values`, delivered with the given `interval` milliseconds, and then closes

`fromPoll(interval, fn)`
creates a channel that polls the given `fn` function, with the given `interval` in milliseconds, and emits the values returned by `fn`. Never ends.

`withInterval(interval, handler)`
creates a channel that calls the given `handler` function, with the given `interval` in milliseconds. The `handler` function is called with one argument â€” a channel.

`fromCallback(callback)`
convert a function than accepts a `callback` as the first argument, to a channel. Emits at most one value when `callback` is called, then ends.

`fromNodeCallback(callback)`
like `fromCallback`, but accepts a node style callback which gets arguments in the form `(err, res)`. throws when an error is passed. 


`fromEvents(emitter, event)`
returns a channel with every `event` from emitter


`log()`
logs every put onto the channel
